				<li>
					<b>Select a Verified Project:</b> Browse through our list of
					impactful and vetted projects. Project Verificationâ€‹.
					'Verified' is a seal of approval for legitimate projects on
					Giveth. If you are a project owner, when you get your
					project verified, your donors become eligible to receive
					GIVbacks. On Giveth verified projects receive more
					donations.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Donate Directly:</b> Once you've chosen a project that
					resonates with you, make your donation. The beauty of
					GIVbacks is that 100% of your donation directly benefits the
					project, ensuring maximum impact.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Earn GIV Tokens:</b> After your donation, Giveth rewards
					you with GIV tokens as a thank you for your generosity.
					These tokens aren't just a reward, they're a representation
					of your contribution to the GIVeconomy. Part will be liquid,
					and part will be added to your{' '}

					until 2026.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>When Do Your Receive Your GIVbacks?:</b> Every two weeks,
					we run a GIVbacks round where we calculate donations and
					distribute GIV tokens to our generous donors.

					GIVbacks are rewarded on the Gnosis and Optimism chain. You
