				<H4>
					Ever wondered if there could be more to giving than just a
					heartfelt thank-you? Enter GIVbacks!
					<br />
					<br />
					GIVbacks are GIV tokens that you receive every time you
					donate to a GIVbacks eligible project on Giveth. Think of
					them like a tax deduction on your donation, but instead of
					needing to fill a form or get a government rebate, you are
					given GIV tokens directly to your wallet!
					<br />
					<br />
					Let’s give an example of how this works. Let’s say you
					donate $100 to a GIVbacks eligible project on Giveth. Based
					on a project's real-time ranking, you could receive up to
					$70 back in GIV token rewards just for donating! Some of
					this amount would be given to you right away (within a 2
					week period), and some of it would be streamed to you over
					the next few years.
					<br />
					<br />
					You can then use those GIV rewards to either take part in
					the governance of the Giveth DAO, earn yield in our GIVfarm,
					donate to other projects, or cash out your GIV rewards.
