    "question": "Does the IRS recognize cryptocurrency donations?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Why donate cryptocurrency?",
    "answer": "Cryptocurrency knows no borders and marginalizes nobody. It can not be taken from you if you hold your keys. \n Another difference: When you donate crypto, you do not recognize capital gains from the crypto you hold and you can deduct it from your taxes. In other words, donating your crypto can often reduce your tax burden. Would you rather donate to the IRS or your favorite cause?"

    "question": "What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?",
    "answer": "Bitcoin is intended to function as decentralized means of value transfer whereas Ethereum is a protocol that allows users to develop decentralized applications on top of a blockchain network. As prominent Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir has confirmed on several occasions, Ethereum is “not money.” Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH) exists in order to facilitate the process of building and deploying distributed applications. Meanwhile, the bitcoin currency exists on the Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of uncensorable, non-confiscatable money from cryptocompare.com (https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-s-the-difference-between-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth)"

  {
    "question": "What is Blockchain?",
    "answer": "Simply, it is a secure form of digital cash that can be transferred anywhere in the world peer-to-peer, similar to email (where the emails server is replaced with a decentralized network). \n More technically, bitcoin is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography and open source software to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. There is a distinction between bitcoin, the digital currency, and Blockchain the technology, which has many additional potential use cases beyond the currency."

  {
    "question": "What is Ethereum?",
    "answer": "It's the world's programmable blockchain.\r\nEthereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.\r\nBoth let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets – even Bitcoin!\r\nThis also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.\r\nSo step into the bazaar and give it a try..."

  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I see in detail what you are spending donations on?",
    "answer": "One of the core values of Giveth is transparency. We invite everyone to have a look at our finances. As a Giver you can also ask us for an exclusive tour of the DApp (beta.giveth.io). The Giveth DAC has its own campaign with funding and payout milestones. The funds of that campaign are usually donated to individual's milestones. All movements are visible at a very granular level in the DApp as well as from an Ethereum blockchain explorer. Access to the DApp is gradually opened up to the wider public."
