Stay tuned...\r\n\r\nGiveth has also partnered with SDG Impact Fund to make it possible for donors to contribute tax-deductible donations, in fiat or crypto, to altruistic projects on the blockchain.

	{
		"question": "Does the IRS recognize cryptocurrency donations?",
		"answer": "The IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as property, so cryptocurrency donations to 501c3 organizations receive the same tax treatment as stocks.\r"
	},
	{
		"question": "Why donate cryptocurrency?",
		"answer": "Cryptocurrency knows no borders and marginalizes no one. It can not be taken from you if you alone hold your keys. \n Another advantage: When you donate with crypto, you do not realize capital gains from the crypto you hold, and you can deduct it from your taxes. In other words, donating your crypto can often reduce your tax burden. Would you rather donate to the IRS or your favorite cause?"

It runs a Distributed Key Generation protocol that allows applications to access its generated keys via OAuths and thus existing user accounts.

		"question": "What is the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?",
		"answer": "Bitcoin is intended to function as decentralized means of value transfer whereas Ethereum is a protocol that allows users to develop decentralized applications on top of a blockchain network. As prominent Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir has confirmed on several occasions, Ethereum is “not money.” Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH) exists in order to facilitate the process of building and deploying distributed applications. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin currency exists on the Bitcoin blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of uncensorable, non-confiscatable money from cryptocompare.com (https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-s-the-difference-between-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth)."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is Blockchain?",
		"answer": "Simply, it is a secure form of digital cash that can be transferred anywhere in the world peer-to-peer, similar to email's (where the emails server is replaced with a decentralized network). \n More technically, Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography and open source software to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. There is a distinction between Bitcoin the digital currency and Blockchain the technology, which has many additional potential use cases beyond the currency."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is Ethereum?",
		"answer": "It's the world's programmable blockchain.\r\nEthereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation with some big differences.\r\nBoth let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for many different digital assets – even Bitcoin!\r\nThis also means Ethereum is for more than just payments. It's a network of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.\r\nSo step into the bazaar, and give it a try..."

	{
		"question": "What is Giveth?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Where can I see in detail what you are spending donations on?",
		"answer": "One of the core values of Giveth is transparency. We invite everyone to have a look at our finances. As a Giver you can also ask us for an exclusive tour of the DApp (beta.giveth.io). The Giveth DAC has its own campaign with funding and payout milestones. The funds of that campaign are usually donated to individual's milestones. All movements are visible at a very granular level in the DApp as well as from an Ethereum blockchain explorer."
