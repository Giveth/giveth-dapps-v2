				<h5>Informal Negotiations</h5>
				<p>
					To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
					controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a
					&quot;Dispute&quot; and collectively, the
					&quot;Disputes&quot;) brought by either you or us
					(individually, a &quot;Party&quot; and collectively, the
					&quot;Parties&quot;), the Parties agree to first attempt to
					negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
					provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days
					before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations
					commence upon written notice from one Party to the other
					Party.
				</p>
				<h5>Binding Arbitration</h5>
				<p>
					If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
					informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
					expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively
					resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
					WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
					COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be
					commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
					Rules of the American Arbitration Association
					(&quot;AAA&quot;) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
					Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
					(&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are
					available at the AAA website:{' '}
					<a
						href='https://adr.org'
						target='_blank'
						rel='noopener noreferrer'
					>
						www.adr.org
					</a>{' '}
					. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
					compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules
					and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
					The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
					submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
					will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
					statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The
					arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
					challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where
					otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
					law, the arbitration will take place in United States,
					Georgia. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
					may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
					proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify,
					vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
					arbitrator.
				</p>
				<p>
					If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
					arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in
					the state and federal courts located in Bartow, Georgia, and
					the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of
					lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with
					respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal
					courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on
					Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the
					Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is
					excluded from these Terms of Use.
				</p>
				<p>
					If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
					then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
					falling within that portion of this provision found to be
					illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided
					by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
					listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to
					submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
				</p>
				<h5>Restrictions</h5>
				<p>
					The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to
					the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
					extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined
					with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or
					authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action
					basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
					is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
					purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
					public or any other persons.
				</p>
				<h5>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h5>
				<p>
					The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
					subject to the above provisions concerning informal
					negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
					seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
					of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b)
					any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
					theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
					(c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is
					found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
					will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
					portion of this provision found to be illegal or
					unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
					of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
					jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
					personal jurisdiction of that court.
