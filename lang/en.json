It can be considered a kind of database that is not stored in a single computer. Instead, many identical copies are distributed in several computers called nodes. Information on a blockchain is stored in a continuous chain of blocks with each block containing essential information (for example, transactions) and the cryptographic hash of the previous block. To change the information in any block, you have to make changes to all subsequent blocks. The content of the blocks is verified by the consensus of all nodes in the network. These two features makes it very difficult to alter any information already included in the blocks, and this difficulty increases with the number of nodes in the network.",
